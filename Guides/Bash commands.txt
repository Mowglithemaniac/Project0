================================================
This document is designed to give you an
introduction to what Linux is, and to become
familiar with the command console.

Linux is the name of a combined group of
Operating Systems, that utilize the UNIX kernel.
It has a modular setup, where you can choose
many aspects to either create your own 'Distro',
or use a preexisting version.

The term 'distro' refers to distribution types.
Distributions are organized based on the 
"Package management system".
There are two primary distribution types
RPM-based, and DEB-based.
RPM uses the .rpm file format, most known
distros are: Red Hat Linux, CentOS, Fedora.
DEB emphasizes 'free software' often referred
to as 'debian type'.
Most known distros are: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, 
Linux Kali.

Because of this distinction, and modular setup,
Some commands may not be natively installed on 
a distro, which means you have to install them
yourself, or the version of a command you have, 
might work slightly differently in your distro
compared to another.

One very strong advantage for choosing Linux
is the powerful setup for creating and managing
servers.

Examples of server types and tools               Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
Apache                                          : Web server
SAMBA                                           : A tool with multiple server and management option for Linux and Unix
                                                  It allows windows to share files and printers on the Unix host
                                                  It also allows Unix users to access resources shared by Windows systems.
Oracle, MySQL (MariaDB), Mongodb, etc.          : Database

Additional server types.
Mail/FTP/DNS/router/firewall and more           

There is a list of useful abbreviations found in
table 1.0 near the end of the document.

Information about the format of this document

'$ ' is used to emulate a command line,
specifically intended for examples of full
commands.
Notice that '$STUFF' refers to variables.

This will be the max width of this file---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->|
: Explanation of command
- Command options, or continuations of the
  previous colon (:) explanation.
[empty] is a pseudonym for not entering anything.
[command] refers to commands themselves
[option] refers to '-operator' options.

From this point forward, this format will
primarily be used, with commands to the left,
and a description of said command to the right.

Some of the most useful tips for navigating and
using the command console, efficiently.

Commands                                         Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
Navigate to folder, then type 'bash'            : Open a terminal, which has already navigated to folder
in the address field.                             Requires that Linux subsystem for Windows is activated
                                                  and that a Linux distribution is virtually installed
                                                  i.e. Microsoft store, Ubuntu (LTS version, which stands
                                                  for 'Long Term Support')

cd                                              : Change Directory, '..' to move up a directory
                                                  When inside a directory and you've typed part of the name
                                                  of a file. hit 'tab' to auto fill out the content.
                                                  Double hit 'tab' to see a list of directories.
                                                - Use '$ cd -' to go back to the directory you were just in
                                                - Use '$ cd /' to go to root directory
                                                - Use '$ cd ~' to go to HOME directory
pwd                                             : Print Working directory.

something '>>' filename                         : Append content to file named filename
something '>' filename                          : Overwrite content of file named filename
                                                  These are great options for pasting output into log files,
                                                  when writing and testing C-programs.
[Example]
echo yolo > derpy.txt                           : Overwrites the content of file derpy.txt "yolo"
echo yolo >> derpy.txt                          : Append "yolo" to the content of file derpy.txt

(if intalled)Type 'code .' to open Visual Studio
Code with that folder already being navigated to.

To compile and run C code files
$ gcc -o newfilename someCcodefile.c            : Will compile the file, and save the compiled version in 'newfilename'
$ ./newfilename                                 : Executes the compiled file.

After writing a command, you sometimes write '-'
and then add an operator, such as
$ ls -l -a
This is equivalent to 
$ ls -la
Because using a single '-' means that each 
character is treated as a separate operator.
If you use '--' the whole word is supplied
as an argument.
$ ls --help

To terminate access, or close the console, 
use the command 'exit'
$ exit        

If the commands are exceedingly long, use '\' as
a method to break the line, and continue writing
a command on  the following line.

The 'grep' command print lines that match
patterns.
Often used in conjunction with the pipeline
character "|", which forwards the output of a
command to another command.

[Example]
$ grep "some text" myfile.txt                   : Search through myfile looking for "some text" and
                                                  print lines that match.
$ top | grep root                               : Will present the processes related to root.

If you screw up somehow, terminate an active
process with [CTRL + C], i.e. 'htop' or an
infinitely running program.

[CTRL + L]                                      : Clears the bash terminal of text.
[CTRL + U]                                      : Cut beginning of line, cut text to the beginning of the line.

A similar tool in Linux, to 'Task Manager' 
from Windows, are the commands 'top', 'htop', 
and 'ps'.

================================================
For some commands, you require root access,
this section explains how to acquire that.

The prompt symbol for regular users is a dollar
sign ($), the prompt symbol for superuser
is hashtag (#), use this as an indicator
to see if you've got direct root access.
Or if you need to request it, in order to run
a command.

================================================
Permission explanation:
https://youtu.be/oxuRxtrO2Ag?t=3490
Set up in relation to separate bits, from left
to right:
r = read                                        : [4] Decimal value #4, == 0x4, == 0b100
w = write                                       : [2] Decimal value #2, == 0x2, == 0b010
x = execute                                     : [1] Decimal value #1, == 0x1, == 0b001

Meaning that:
7 = read, write, execute privilege [111]
6 = read and write privilege       [110]
5 = read and execute privilege     [101]
and so on

-rwxrwxrwx
|||||||||!------------------------------------> : Execute bit, for 'Other'
||||||||! ------------------------------------> : Write bit, for 'Other'
|||||||! -------------------------------------> : Read bit, for 'Other'
||||||! --------------------------------------> : Execute bit, for 'Group'
|||||! ---------------------------------------> : Write bit, for 'Group'
||||! ----------------------------------------> : Read bit, for 'Group'
|||! -----------------------------------------> : Execute bit, for 'User'
||! ------------------------------------------> : Write bit, for 'User'
|! -------------------------------------------> : Read bit, for 'User'
! --------------------------------------------> : {d, 1, b, c, s, p}

When using the 'chmod' command, you  enter 3 numbers
The first number represents the owner
The second number represents the group
The 3rd number represents everybody else.

$ chmod 744 filename.sh                         : Permission will look like this -rwxr--w--
$ chmod u+x filename.c                          : Adding execute permission of the file to user
$ chmod g+w filename.c                          : Adding write permission of the file to Group
$ chmod o+r filename.c                          : Adding read permission of the file to 'Other users'

With the 'ls -l' command, you can view permissions
The first permission character have multiple meanings

|               System/User Info               |
================================================
Information related to the OS, and user.
Such as processes, users, calender and more.
Unlike Windows, Linux does not have a Task
Manager, so you need to be comfortable with
commands such as 'top' and 'htop'.

This paragraph refers to specific usage of the
'ps' and 'top' command.

This part refers primarily to the output of the
'ps' command, no version of the 'ps' command,
contain all of these, or even with the same
format or name.

WCHAN                                           : Memory address of the event the process is waiting for

Moving on to the command 'top', output varies
greatly between the versions and distributions.
General information is found in the 1st row.
You can see how long the system has been up,
how many users are currently logged in to the
system, and how much demand there has been on
the system for the past 1, 5, 10 minutes.

The 'NI' column, stands for 'nice', which is a
parameter used to determine how nice a process
is towards others, it ranges from -20 to 19.
The value directly relates to how nice the
process is to others, by default the value
is '0'.

Shortcuts for 'top' is somewhat different, as
you need to press the shortcuts while the
command is running, rather than supplying it
with arguments.

These shortcuts can be used to display
information in different ways while 'top'
is actively running.

                                                  "userdel" command instead.
        --remove-home [username]                - This syntax is for Debian Distributions
                                                  Will delete the user

[Example]
$ sudo deluser --remove-home derp               : Removes user 'derp'

There is a utility called 'Access Control List'
which can be used to set permissions on files
for different users. In order to access the
commands, ACL must be enabled when the
filesystem is mounted.

setfacl                                         : Setting the ACL status of a file
getfacl                                         : Getting the ACL status of a file 

[Example]
$ setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename            : -m option, modify permission, for username, to rwx, on file filename
$ getfacl temp.txt                              :

To see whether the ACL status is available on an
ext4 file system use the 'tune2fs -l' command, 
to view the implemented mount options.

[Example]
mount -t ext3 -o acl [device-name] [partition]
$ mount -t ext3 -o acl /dev/folderA/folderAA /work

|          Packages and installations          |
================================================
Update/upgrade dependencies and installed
content (use sudo), theres' a massive difference
between debian and .rpm based distros.
Debian based distributions handle dependencies
directly when you acquire and install packages.
Wish I could say the same for .rpm distros.

Debian based distros use "apt" or "apt-get"
For a detailed list, use these two commands.

$ sudo apt-get --help
$ sudo apt --help

These are the most commonly used debian based
commands:
------------------------------------------------|---------------
$ sudo apt-get update                           : Retrieve new lists of packages
$ sudo apt-get upgrade                          : Perform an upgrade of packages
$ sudo apt-get build-essential                  : A collection of packages required to compile and run a number of different
                                                  programming languages, such as C, C++
$ sudo apt search [NAME]                        : Display a list of available packages related to the search parameter                        
$ sudo apt-get install [PACKAGE]                : Install package
$ sudo apt install [PACKAGE]                    : Install package
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade                     : Update the kernel packages

[Example DEB based]
$ sudo apt search music                         : Find packages related to music
$ sudo apt-get install [PACKAGENAME]            : Install a specific package, i.e. nmap
$ sudo apt install nmap                         : install nmap

And similar for .rpm distros, these two are the
primary method for managing and installation.
yum [option] [command]                          : (For RPM distros) Install, Uninstall, Update Packages
                                                  Now outdated 
dnf [option] [command]                          : (For RPM distros) 'Dandified YUM', it is an upgraded version of YUM,
                                                  available since version 18 of Fedora. Syntax somewhat identical to YUM

Hard drives, can be divided into several
partitions, each with their own file system.

In Windows, partitions are handled automatically
(if reckognized) and are placed next to the
'C:' drive, thus clearly sectioned apart within 
the Windows OS.

It is different and quite unique for Linux.
In Linux, partitions added directly into
the existing directory stucture.
This require a mount point, within the existing : THIS IS A REQUIREMENT(!!!)
Linux OS file structure to be created, and ready
to accept the new partition.
This mount point should (highly recommended) be
empty, otherwise the files already located
within, will become hidden. (Not deleted)
Until the partition is demounted.

When handled automatically, partitions are
usually located at /mnt/... for regular drives,
or /media for removable media devices, such as
DVD or CD.

Som basic info about common file systems, and
denominators between Windows OS, and Linux OS.

File System                                      Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
VFAT                                            : Lowest common denominator between Linux and Windows.
                                                  Often used by USB-drives
exFAT                                           : Often used by USB-drives
                                                  Linux may support it, if not requires additional kernel drivers.
NTFS                                            : Standard file system for Windows
                                                  Linux may support it, if not requires additional kernel drivers.

Ext4 is the standard file system for Linux.

To add a new physical storage medium (usb, hdd,
ssd, or similar), to your computer, so that it
can be used by Linux, you need to connect it
physically, and then partition it.
Usually done this way.
1. Install the new hard drive or insert the new
   USB flash drive.
2. Partition the new disk.
3. Create the file system on the new disk.
4. Mount the filesystems

You can view disk partitions with the command:
$ parted -l 

This is the syntax for the 'mount' command.
mount [options] <-t type> [-o mount options] <device> <mounting point>
                                                : Syntax for the mount command

================================================
'Vi' is often the default text editor for Linux,
VIM is the upgraded version, and an editor of
choice for many.
It is a "modal" text editor, meaning that it has
different modes available, such as:
command(default), insert, last-line, and 
possibly more, depending on whom you ask.

In command mode, you have access to very
different tools, such as saving, exiting, 
highlighting, and so on,
Whereas 'insert'-mode is about editing the 
content of the file directly.

If you're in 'insert'-mode, hit the ESC
key, to go to the Command mode.

Obviously arrow keys work the same.

These are some of the most common
shortcuts that you are going to need.

Shortcuts:

Character movement                               Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
h                                               : Moves the cursor one character to the left.

`.                                              : Move to the last edit.

Some of these commands can be 'prefaced',
meaning that if you use the command 10b, you
move back 10 words. Or if you use 11w, move
forward 11 words.

|            Configuring your shell            |
================================================
It is possible to make alterations to the shell
to work more efficently.
Such as: Setting new aliases to store
information, shortcuts to folders, favorite 
commands, and more.
By adding these alterations to the right 
configuration files, you can ensure they're
always available whenever you open a new shell.

* Configuring your shell
There are seveval configuration files that
determine how you shell behaves. Some are tied
to every user and every shell, but others are
tied to the specific user who created the
configuration file.

Table list 1.1 shows the files that are of
interest to anyone using the bash shell in
Linux. (Notice the use of ~ in the filenames to
indicate that the file is located in each user's
home directory.) To change the /etc/profile or
/etc/bashrc files, you must be the root user.
It is better to create an
/etc/profile.d/custom.sh file to add system/wide
settings instead of editing those files directly,
however. Users can change the information in the
$HOME/.bash_profile, $HOME/.bashrc, and
$HOME/.bash_logout files in their own home
directories.

[Example 1]
To edit the environment, we want to alter the
configuration file $HOME/.bashrc, as a plaintext
file via 'vim', we use the command
$ vim $HOME/./bashrc
Go to the bottom and include an extra line
alias derp='watch free -h'
A new alias has now been set, to access the
command without having to restart the console
use this command $ source $HOME/.bashrc
Alternatively, restart the console.
Can be done with the command 
$ exec bash

================================================
|              Setting your prompt             |
================================================
The prompt, are the characters that appear on 
the command line on the shell, to the left of
when you enter commands.
The details for how that is set up, is found 
within the PS1 environment variable.
The PS2-PS4 variables are used for additional
input.

When installed, the prompt is usually set up
to contain {Your username, your hostname, 
the base name of your current working directory}
For regular users, they're followed by a dollar
sign ($), and pound sign (#) for the root user.

Here is an example of that prompt:
[declined@LAPTOP-E9IBLV7O: folderA] $

By changing directory, the folderA name would
change to the name of the new directory.
If we were to switch to a different user, or
system that information would change as well.

It's possible to alter the prompt significantly
to even include a date, terminal number and 
additional pieces of information.

Table 1.2 show some examples of characters to
add information to Bash prompt.
For additional info, see the bash man page.

Changing to the PS1 variable directly, is only
valid until the prompt is restarted.
To make it permanent, you need to alter the
value within the .bashrc file found in your
home directory.
There may already be a PS1 variable, within
that file which can be modified, although
a safer solution would be to uncomment the 
setence, and write your own custom settings.
So that you can revert easily to a prior 
setting.

There is a link in references with a HOWTO
for changing colors commands and other
features of your bash shell prompt.

[Example]
Alter the PS1 variable, remember to store it
first, and know that it is only valid until
you restart the shell.
$ temp=$PS1
[For debian]
$ PS1='\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
[For RHEL]
$ PS1='\e[33;1m\u@\h: \e[31m\w\e[0m\$ '

You can restart the shell with the command:
$ exec bash

If you want to try this in practice, login to
the LSF 10 cluster on DTU, and change the PS1
variable, in the .bashrc file.

================================================
|         Adding environment variables         |
================================================
You can make working with the shell more
efficient and effective, by making changes to
the .bashrc file.
This can be done by altering or defining the
variables.

[TMOUT]
This variable determine how how long the shell
can be inactive before bash automatically exits.
The value is defined in seconds, and it is a
nice security feature, in case you leave the
desk while still logged into Linux.
To close the shell after a set number of seconds
set the TMOUT value to the desired amount of
time. Example TMOUT=1800 means 30 minutes.

[PATH]
the PATH variable sets the directories that are
searched for, for the commands that you use.
If you often use directories of commands that
are not in your path, you can permanently add
them. To do this, add a PATH variable to your
.bashrc file. For example, to add a directory
called /herpderp/bin, add the following:

PATH=$PATH:/herpderp/bin ; export PATH

This example first reads all of the current
path directories into the new PATH ($PATH),
adds the /herpderp/bin directory, and then
exports the new PATH.

[User defined]
You can create your own environment variables
to provide shortcuts in your work. Choose any
name that is not being used and assign a useful
value to it. For example, if you do lots of
work with files in the /workspace/project1
directory, you could set the following variable:

DERP=/mnt/c/Users/Computer/workspace/project1 ; export DERP

You could make that your current directory with
the command:
$ cd $DERP
You could run a program from that directory
called derpina with the command:
$ .$DERP/derpina
You could edit a file from there called troll
with the command:
$ vi $DERP/troll

The 'export' command is a built-in command of
the Bash shell. It is used to mark variables and
functions to be passed to child processes.

================================================
|                  Job control                 |
================================================
When running jobs, you sometimes want the
process running, but still require access to
the console.
That's where the concept of background and
foreground comes into the picture.
On top of that, it's possible to disown a
process, so that it'll continue running, even if
the console is closed.

Foreground jobs are ones that don’t return you
to the command prompt until you exit out of the
job or the job finishes. (example htop)
Background refers to jobs that aren't actively
displayed in the console window, but can be
viewed with the command 'jobs'.

These jobs can be 'running' or 'stopped'.
Background jobs with status 'running' run
exactly  the as if it were in the foreground,
except that it does not receive user input, and
output is still processed accordingly.
Be aware that background processes can still
output something, despite running in the
background, so you can redraw the screen
with [CTRL + L].
The status 'stopped' is considered hibernation.
They do not receive user input, and do not
produce an output.
They don't do anything, and will continue
not doing anything until they're resumed or
killed.

To see a list of processes running in the
background use the command 'jobs'.
To access specific jobs, use the '%'
percentage sign, followed by the number.

Accessing background jobs:                       Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
%JOB_SPEC                                       : Refers to a specific job.
%                                               : Refers to the most recent command put into the background
                                                  (indicated by the plus sign when you type the jobs command).
                                                  This action brings the command to the foreground
%string                                         : Refers to a job where the command begins with a particular
                                                  string of characters. The string must be unambiguous. (there
                                                  mustn't be multiple commands starting wit the same string)
%?string                                        : Refers to a job where the command line contains a string at
                                                  any point. The string must be unambiguous or the match fails.
%--                                             : Refers to the job stopped before the one most recently stopped

There  are 2 primary ways (that I know of) to
send jobs to the background, notice how one
grants the 'running' status, and the other
provides the 'stopped' status.

Add an ampersand '&' at the end of a command    : Automatically sends the process to the background when the process is created,
                                                  and then display 2 numbers, first  number is the JOB_SPEC, the second number
                                                  is the Processor ID (PID). Setting the status to 'running'.
[CTRL + Z]                                      : Send a SIGTSTP signal, forcing the job to the background
                                                  Setting the status to 'stopped'

The command 'bg' is used to alter the status of
of a background job, from stopped to 'running'.
'fg' is used, to bring a background process
to the foreground.
Use the commands 'fg' and 'bg' to manage/access
the processes, and commands like 'kill' or
'disown' to  terminate and/or let programs
continue to run, even if you close the console.
Remember to use %JOB_SPEC to access  the specific
process directly.

Command                                          Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
jobs                                            : Display background jobs (hint use -l operator to view PID as well as status)
bg                                              : Move jobs to the background.
                                                  Simulates running in the foreground, same as if it had been started with ' &' 
                                                 Place the jobs identified by each JOB_SPEC in the background,
                                                  If JOB_SPEC is not present, the shell's notion of the current job is used.
fg                                              : Brings a job from the background, to the foreground.
                                                  Located with jobspec
kill                                            : Duplicate in document
disown                                          : Disowns background processes in different ways.
                                                  If no JOB_SPEC is used, the command applies to all jobs in the background.
        -h                                      - If background job status is 'Running', ensures that SIGHUP signal is not sent to
                                                  process, when the shell terminates.
        -a                                      - Remove all jobs if JOB_SPEC is not supplied
        -r                                      - Remove only Running jobs

[Example of management]
$ ping google.com
[CTRL + Z]
$ watch free -h & 
$ htop [CTRL + Z]
$ jobs -l
Now we use the command 'bg' to simulate 'htop'
being started with a ' &' at the end of the
command.
$ bg %3
$ jobs -l
Now we can use the command 'fg' to bring a process
to the foreground, kill it or something else.
$ kill -9 %1
$ fg %2
$ [CTRL + C]
$ jobs -l
And for good measure, we clean up the background.
$ disown -a

================================================
|                Managing groups               |
================================================
If you're new to Linux, never ever try managing
creating, or working with groups for a very
simple reason.

It can cause your computer to become unbootable

Table 1.6 lists a number of options that can
be used to manage groups.

If you're running a full distribution of Fedora
or RHEL distros, there is a graphical tool
called "Cockpit"
It can be installed like this.
[Example]
$ yum install cockpit -y
$ systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
Then open the cockpit interface via the web
browser. In the address field, type in:
(hostname:9090)
From there you can manage accounts.

================================================
|                Shell scripting               |
================================================
Shell scripting are primarily used for task
automation. It is capable of executing multiple
commands, take input, customizing administrative
tasks and so on.

There are 2 ways to execute shell scripts.
By using the 'bash' command, or running the file
as an executable.

[Example]
$ bash test.sh
$ ./test.sh

This link explains a lot of the syntax involved
https://linuxhint.com/30_bash_script_examples/

The 1st line of a shell script should be:
#!/bin/bash

It's possible to create variables. Variable
names are case sensitive. 
Variables can contain a number of things such as
numeric, strings, output of functions, and so on.
To create them, there must NOT be a space between
the variable name, and the content. For
functions, use a dollar sign, then parenthesis.
A single hashtag (#) is used as a single line
comment.

[Examples]
VAR1=6465.7270
VAR2="derp"
VAR3=$(date)

Some characters have special meaning in the shell

Special meaning                                  Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
'enclosedwithin'                                : ' ', literal translation of content within brackets
\followingcharacter                             : Backslash, literal translation of the following character
"STRING"                                        : Content within "" is parsed as a string, variables are
                                                  still considered as such.
$STRING                                         : Name of a variable.

Commonly used parameter expansions in bash
shell scripting:
${var:-value}                                   : If variable is unset or empty expand this to value.
${var#pattern}                                  : Chop the shortest match for pattern from the front of var's value.
${var##pattern}                                 : Chop the longest match for pattern from the front of var's value.
${var%pattern}                                  : Chop the shortest match for pattern from the end of var's value.
${var%%pattern}                                 : Chop the longest match for pattern from the end of var's value.

[Examples]                                      : Try these to see the output.
$ THIS="This is an example"
$ THIS=${THIS:-"Not set"}
$ THAT=${THAT:-"Not set"}
$ echo $THIS
This is an example
$ echo $THAT
Not set

Syntax for 'if', 'else if', 'then', 'then', can
be setup using this format:
if  [argument] ; then                           : If argument is true, then do....
...
elif [argument]                                 : 'Else if'-statement
...
else                                            : 'Else'-statement
...
fi                                              : indicates the end of the 'if'-statement.

[Example]                                       : Operators found in table 1.7
filename="$HOME"
if [ -f "$filename" ] ; then
   echo "$filename is a regular file"
elif [ -d "$filename" ]
   echo "$filename is a directory"
else
   echo "No clue what $filename is."
fi

There is also a shorthand method for an 
if-statement with a single command.
[statement] || [command]                        : If statement fails run [command]
[statement] && [command]                        : If statement succeed run [command]


The 'case' command, otherwise known as a switch,
')' is used for different cases, and '*)' is
used as a default (catchall) case.
'|' is used as an 'OR' bitwise operator.
'esac' is used to end the switch.
The argument can be a number of things including
but not limited to {variable, command, string}
Syntax is:
case [argument] in
';;' is used to end each case.

--------------------[Example]-------------------
# Here we're using the date command 'day' output.
#!/bin/bash
case $(date +%a) in
    "Mon" | "Wed")
        echo "Day is uneven"
        ;;
    "Tue" | "Thu")
        echo "Day is even"
        ;;
    "Fri")
        echo "Almost weekend"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Either it's weekend, or I screwed up"
        ;;
esac
----------------------[END]---------------------

Loop types.
There are 3 loop types 'for', 'while', 'until'.
Syntax are:

for [variable] in [LIST]
do
   ...
done

while [condition]
do
   ...
done

until [condition]
do
   ...
done

It is possible to disable shell functions,
variables and references with 'unset'.

Command-mode                                     Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
unset [-f] [-v] [-n] [name ...]                 : Unset a function
        -f                                      - Treat each NAME as a shell function
        -v                                      - Treat each NAME as a shell variable
        -n                                      - Treat each NAME as a name reference and unset the variable itself
                                                  rather than the variable it references

================================================
|                 System calls                 |
================================================
In order to function, most user level commands
and services require access to operations that
are only processed at kernel level.
An example of these kernel operations would be:
Creating processes, network and file IO,
hardware access, and more.

'System calls' are the intermediate point
that allow programs to request limited access
to the kernel.
Essentially an API to allow low level, and user
level programs and services, access to the
kernel.

The specific implementation varies somewhat
<based on cpu architecture and OS, but for now
assume it is all combined within wrapper
functions, such as those supplied by glibc on   : C library, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc
Linux. This allow a higher abstraction level.

Services Provided by System Calls:
•    Process creation and management
•    Main memory management
•    File Access, Directory and File system
     management
•    Device handling(I/O)
•    Protection
•    Networking, etc.

For Linux, the most common system calls are:
open, close, fork, wait, read, write, pipe,
kill, exit, exec.
In order to understand what these mean, I'll
provide a brief explanation for each of these.

Most of these aren't just C-functions, or
commands on a command line.
Look at the manual page for each of these, and
see the category they belong to.

System call                                      Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
open                                            : open, openat, creat - Open and possibly create a file
close                                           : Close a file descriptor
                                                - File descriptor is integer that uniquely identifies an open file of
                                                  the process.
fork                                            : Create a child process.
                                                  The child process is almost identical to the calling process, the 'fork'
                                                  function return
                                                  a PID, which is set to 0 in the child, but for the parent it is the PID of
                                                  the child. If it returns -1, it means that no child was created.
wait                                            : Wait for process to change state.
                                                  This is specifically used, to reap child processes who becomes zombies.
                                                  When a child process end, rather than dying and releasing all data, it turn
                                                  into a zombie, where associated data is released, but the PID still remain,
                                                  and is tied to the child.
                                                  Using kill on a zombie won't remove it, and there is a limited amount of PID
                                                  available on a Linux OS, which is why it is imperative for programs to reap
                                                  their zombie children.

                                                  commands, turns the executing program into a zombie, which is why you need to
                                                  create a child, who can execute the command, without affecting the parent.

There are 5 types of system calls.
•   Process control: end, abort, create,
                     terminate, allocate
                     and free memory.
•   File management: create, open, close,
                     delete, read file etc.
•   Device management
•   Information maintenance
•   Communication

Now knowing all of this, when you execute a
command, a lot of stuff is happening under the
hood that you aren't aware of, including quite
a few system calls.

In order to test this for yourself, there are a
number of commands, and manual pages you can
read.

Commands                                         Manual description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
syscall                                         : Indirect system call
syscalls                                        : Linux system calls
strace                                          : Trace system calls and signals
ltrace                                          : A library call tracer
ptrace                                          : Process trace
ftrace                                          : Runs the frysk systemcall tracing utility.
                                                - Something about a similar manner to strace, and based on RHEL, rather than DEB.
truss                                           : Trace system calls and signals

[Example]
$ strace ls -la */                              : Display system calls, made during the 'ls' command.
$ ltrace -S ls -la */                           : Also display system and library calls, made during the 'ls' command.

To give you a sense of the scale, there are:    : Source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call
More than 300 system calls on Linux,
NetBSD has close to 500,
FreeBSD has over 500,
Windows has close to 2000, (divided between
        win32k (graphical) and ntdll (core)
        system calls).
'Plan 9' has 51.
No details about Mac.

|                   nslookup                   |
================================================
'nslookup' is tool to query Internet name
servers interactively.
As far as I can make out, this command syntax is
identical for both cmd and Bash.

Command syntax                                   Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
nslookup [website]                              : Provides generic information about a website, such as IP and dns
nslookup -[option] [website]                    : Provides information about a websited specified by the option
nslookup [-option] [name | -] [server]
nslookup –option1 –option2 host-to-find simulated-dns-server
                                                : It is possible to supply 0, 1, 2 or more options
                                                  as well as 2 servers, where the 1st will be queried
                                                  and the 2nd is optional.
                                                  If excluded it'll be sent to the default DNS server

Option list                                       Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
A                                               : Specifies a computer's IP address.

PTR                                             : Specifies a computer name if the query is an IP address; otherwise, specifies
                                                  the pointer to other information.
SOA                                             : Specifies the start-of-authority for a DNS zone.

WKS                                             : Describes a well-known service.

Notice that these syntaxes cause an identical,
response,  {"type", "q", "query}
Example:
nslookup -type=mx dtu.dk                        : Identical
nslookup -q=mx dtu.dk                           : Identical
nslookup -query=mx dtu.dk                       : Identical

: ALTERNATE syntax
Type in 'nslookup', and you'll get a '>'
type in:
> set q=[option]
> [website]

:Examples
$ nslookup -type=mx dtu.dk                      : Info about the mail exchange server for DTU
$ nslookup -query=hinfo  -timeout=10 [website]  : Generates a query, using the hinfo option, with timeout 10 to dtu.dk.
$ nslookup dtu.dk google.com                    : Here we send our query to google.com which will query dtu.dk on our behalf
                                                  and then google will provide us with the result.

\s                                              : This diplays the current shell name. For the bash shell,
                                                  the value would be bash.

/bin                                            : Contains common Linux user commands, such as ls, sort, date and chmod
/boot                                           : Has the bootable Linux kernel, initiam RAM disk, and boot loader
                                                  configuration files (GRUB)
/dev                                            : Contains files representing access points to devices on your system.
                                                  These include terminal devices (tty*), hard disks (hd* or sd*), RAM
                                                  (ram*), and CD-ROM (cd*). Users can access these devices directly
                                                  through these device files; however applications often hide the actual
                                                  device names to end users.
/etc                                            : Contains administrative configuration files. Most fo these files are
                                                  plain-text files that, given the user has proper permission, can be
                                                  edited with any text editor
/home                                           : Contains directories assigned to each regular user with a login account.
                                                  (The root user is an exception, using /root as his or her home directory.)
/media                                          : Provides a standard location for automounting devices (removable media in
                                                  particular). If the medium has a volume name, that name is typically used
                                                  as the mount point. For example, a USB drive with a volume name of myusb
                                                  would be mounted on /media/myusb
/lib                                            : Contains shred libraries needed by applicatiosn in /bin and /sbin to
                                                  boot systems.
/mnt                                            : A common mount point for many devices before it was supplanted by the 
                                                  standard /media directory. Some bootable Linux systems still use this
                                                  directory to mount hard disk partitions and remote filesystems.
                                                  Many people still use this directory to temporarily mount local or remote
                                                  filesystems, which are not mounted permanently.
/misc                                           : A directory sometimes used to automount filesystem upon request
/opt                                            : Directory structure available to store add-on application software.
/proc                                           : Contains information about system resources
/root                                           : Represents the root user's home diretory. The home directory for root
                                                  does not reside beneath /home for seurity reasons.
/sbin                                           : Contains administrative commands and daemon processes
/sys                                            : Contains parameters for such things as tuning block storage and managing
                                                  cgroups.
/tmp                                            : Contains temporary files used by applications.
/usr                                            : Contains user documentation, games, graphicalfiles (X11), libraries (lib),
                                                  and a variety of other commands and files that are not needed during the
                                                  boot process. The /usr directory is meant for files that don't change
                                                  after installation (in theory, /usr could be mounted read-only).
/var                                            : Contains directories of data used by various applications. In particular,
                                                  this is where you would place files that you share as an FTP server
                                                  (/var/ftp) or a web server (/var/www). It also contains all system log
                                                  files (/var/log) and spool files in /var/spool (such as mail, cups, and
                                                  news). The /var directory contains directories and files that are meant
                                                  to change often. On server computers, it is common to create the /var
                                                  directory as a separate filesystem, using a filesystem that that can be
                                                  easily expanded.

Topics                                           Description
------------------------------------------------|---------------
Storage (blkio)                                 : Limits total input and output access to storage devices (such as hard
                                                  disks, USB drives, and so on)
Processor scheduling (cpu)                      : Assigns the amount of access a cgroup has to be scheduled for
                                                  processing power.
Process accounting (cpuacct)                    : Reports on CPU usage. This information can be leveraged to charge
                                                  clients for the amount of processing power they use.
CPU assignment (cpuset)                         : On systems with multiple CPU cores, assigns a task to a particular set
                                                  of processors and assiciated memory.
Device access (devices)                         : Allows tasks in a cgroup to open or create (mknod) selected device
                                                  types.
Suspend/resume (freezer)                        : Suspends and resumes cgroup tasks
Memory usage (memory)                           : Limits memory usage by task. It also creates reports on memory
                                                  resources used.
Network bandwidth (net_cls)                     : Limits network access to selected cgroup tasks. This is done by
                                                  tagging network packets to identify the cgroup task that originated
                                                  the packet and having the Linux traffic controller monitor and restrict
                                                  packets coming from each group.
Network traffic (net_prio)                      : Sets priorities of network traffic coming from selected cgroups and
                                                  lets administrators change these priorites on the fly.
Name spaces (ns)                                : Separates cgroups into namespaces, so processes in one cgroup can only
                                                  see the namespaces associated with the cgroup. Namespaces can include
                                                  separate process tables, mount tables, and network interfaces.
