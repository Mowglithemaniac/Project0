Kerckhoffs' principle
- An algorithm's security should not rely on the
  secrecy of the algorithm.
- Violation of this principle is called
  "Security by Obscurity".

Security is a wide concept, cryptography is about
reliably turning transfering data securely while
preventing outside influence from figuring out
the content.

While many modern techniques rely heavily on
math, a lot of cryptographic methods are based
on obfuscation.
Stegonography is a good example, where the goal
is to hide a message within another message, in
such a way, that no one other than the intended
target knows of it's existance.
Easily one in pictures, where altering the least
significant bit, won't have any effect on the
picture, but is sufficient to store an amount
of data, without a casual onlooker realizing the
significance.

I will use this set of characters to simulate
boxes, and visuals.

While obviously providing confidentiality,
cryptography are often required to also include
- Authentification
  Ensuring that the message really is sent from
  the right person, not someone pretending to
  be the original sender.
- Integrity
  Ensuring that the message has not been altered
- Nonrepudiation
  Proving that a message has been sent.

Basic topics                                     Brief explanation
------------------------------------------------|----------
Hash/hashing                                    : One way algorithm
                                                - Take in a variable lenght input and output a fixed length out
Symmetric cryptography                          : Requires a key, 
                                                - The same key is used for encryption as well as decryption
Asymmetric cryptography                         : Requires a public and private key, for each party
                                                - Only the paired public key can decrypt what the private key encrypted
                                                  and vice versa.
Padding                                         : Padding means adding additional data/bits to a message for a specific purpose
                                                  such as obfuscating the content.
                                                - It is also used in hashing, as hashes technically take in blocks of a fixed
                                                  length and if the input does not match up, additional bits are padded to the
                                                  end, in order to make it reach that size.
                                                - Same concept with Block Cipher modes, in order for the input to be of a fixed
                                                  length

Means of authenticating a users identity         Explanation and example
------------------------------------------------|----------
Knowledge                                       : Something the individual knows, which should be unique to that person
                                                - Password, Personal Identification Number, Answers to specific questions
Token                                           : Something the individual possess
                                                - Cryptographic keys, electronic keycards, smart cards, physical keys
Static biometrics                               : Something the individual is                                                
                                                - Fingerprints, retina, medical history
Dynamic biometrics                              : Something the individual does
                                                - Voice pattern, handwriting characteristics, typing rythm.

These are 2 real life examples that are worth
mentioning in regard to secrecy.
There is a lightbulb which flourescence mimics
mimics and reflects audio waves. By monitoring
the light source emitted, an attacker can hear
anything that goes on in a room, even from
across the street.

It is possible to create a small partition on a
USB drive, that is invisible to the Operating
System, thus making it appear like a normal USB
drive.

First the basics.

For symmetric cryptography, the same key is used
for both encryption and decryption.

    ***
Asymmetric
While symmetric cryptography is easily relatable
the trick to understanding private/public keys
of asymmetric cryptography, is that keys are a
pair, with a unique ability.
A public key can be used to encrypt a plaintext
but only the paired private key can be used to
decrypt the ciphertext.
And vice versa, where the private key can
encrypt a plaintext, and the paired public key
can decrypt the resulting ciphertext.
Because of this ability, it is imperative to
keep the private key safe and secure.

The primary advantage of using a symmetric
cryptography scheme, is the speed. It can be 
about 50 times faster, to achieve the same
level of security compared to asymmetric.
This is because asymmetric keys are very math
heavy, and for machines to calculate the  output,
is incredibly computational heavy.

Therefore public/private keys are generally used
between two parties, to agree on the use of a
symmetric key.
This process is generally described as a "key
exchange method", where 'Diffie-Hellman' is the
most famous method.
Elliptic Curve Cryptography, is a mathematical
method based on elliptic curves, the purpose is
for keys to achieve a higher level security 
for their length, compared to conventional
public/private keys.

Data is en/de-crypted in blocks, and there are a
number of common algorithms to achieve this.
These are placed under the umbrella term:
Block Encryption                                : Basic knowledge
------------------------------------------------|----------
DES                                             : Symmetric, insecure, can be brute forced easily
                                                - Key length 56 bits, data block size 64 bits
Tripple DES (Commonly known as 3DES)            : DES used 3 times in a row, with 2 keys
                                                - Key lenght 2x56 bits, data block size of 192 bits
                                                - To encrypt: DES{Encrypt(key1), Decrypt(key2), Encrypt(key1)}
                                                - To decrypt: DES{Decrypt(key1), Encrypt(key2), Decrypt(key1)}
AES                                             : Advanced Encryption Standard, assymmetric
                                                - Usually 128, 192 or 256 bit key length, block size 128
RSA                                             : Asymmetric, creates a pair of "commutative" keys
                                                - Based on prime numbers, and with big enough primes become
                                                  impossible to crack.
                                                  Minimum 1024 bit key length, recommended length 2048
DSA                                             : Digital Signature Algorithm, based on the concept of
                                                  'modular exponentiation and discrete logarithm problem'
                                                  It is used for digital signatures, and uses a different algorithm than RSA
Ceasar Cipher                                   : Take the alphabet, and shift the letter [XX] places
Stream Cipher                                   : Generate a VERY long bit stream, and XOR it with the plaintext
                                                  to generate a ciphertext.
Substitution Cipher                             : Each individual character is replaced with a different character

Computers aren't capable of generating a true
random number generator, which is why behind
the scenes they rely on the clock, to provide
the seed.

A source of true randomness would be noise when
listening to the galaxy.

This concept of ramdomness, is how Stream
ciphers are used in practice.

it is very useless, if you end up processing
multiple identical blocks. Also weak against

Note: The MAC algorithm isn't relevant, pay
attention to the use of a key.

Displaying 3 different methods, notice that they
all require the use of hashing.
• Symmetric encryption
• Asymmetric encryption
• Secret value

For the sake of keeping this simple, I am using
letters to denote different things, the specific
protocol/method/algorithm is irrelevant.
E   - Encryption
H   - Hashing
D   - Decryption
K   - Key
PRa - Private key from 'Alice'
PUa - Public key from 'Alice'

|                     Hash                     |
================================================
A hash function, is a one-way algorithm where
the fixed length output is computationally
infeasible to find a collision for.
Changing a single bit in the input message will
on average change half the bits of the output.
It is impossible to go back and calculate the
input, if you only have the output.

It is therefore highly unlikely to find 2
messages with the same output.
This concept is called collision resistance, and
is why and how hashing algorithms are considered
secure.
Do note, that older hashing algorithms with a
shorter output, such as MD5 are no longer
considered secure, since their collision
resistance isn't great enough, and thus
susceptible for finding messages with identical
output with readily available force.

The output of a hash message, is often referred
to as one of these things: {compression function,
contraction function, message digest, fingerprint,
cryptographic checksum, message integrity check
(MIC), and manipulation detection code (MDC)}.

Hashing in cryptography, is not to be confused
with "hash tables" which is a data structure
used in programming.

Database and keys                               : Hashes are often used in databases, rather than storing
                                                 the password in plaintext they store the message digest.

TPM hash table                                  : Trusted Platform Module (TPM), is a physical hardware component
                                                  that is tamper resistant, making it very difficult to physically
                                                  access the data and computations on the component.
                                                  By creating a hash of the components of the system, and storing it
                                                  in a table, it is possible to see if any alterations have been made
                                                  that would render the hardware insecure.

At the time of writing this, the minimum length
of output should be 256 bits, and the use of 
SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
